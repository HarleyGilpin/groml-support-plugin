# üß© Groml Support Plugin

**Groml Support** is an IntelliJ plugin that brings first-class support for the [Groml configuration language‚ÄîGreg‚Äôs Really Obvious Minimal Language](https://github.com/GregHib/void/tree/9709cc14e448617ec0cfe23b3921b7287950d221/config).


<!-- Plugin description -->
Adds syntax highlighting and parsing support for Groml configuration files (`.toml`), including sections, keys, values, arrays, and maps.

Groml sits between a simplified TOML and an extended INI in terms of complexity. This plugin ensures `.toml` files written in Groml are parsed and highlighted accurately, avoiding false errors and enabling useful development features.
