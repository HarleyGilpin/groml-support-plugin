# 🧩 Groml Support Plugin

**Groml Support** is an IntelliJ plugin that brings first-class support for the Groml configuration language—Greg’s Really Obvious Minimal Language.

Groml sits between a simplified TOML and an extended INI in terms of complexity. This plugin ensures `.toml` files written in Groml are parsed and highlighted accurately, avoiding false errors and enabling useful development features.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Custom Syntax Highlighting**  
  Distinguishes sections, keys, values, arrays, maps, and comments using color-coded formatting.

- 🧠 **Accurate Parsing**  
  Recognizes Groml syntax and avoids TOML validation errors on valid Groml files.

- 🧬 **Section Inheritance Support**  
  Supports Groml’s inheritance model with the `.` prefix (e.g., `[.child]` expands parent sections).

- 🪓 **Groml-Specific Validation**  
  Detects syntax errors such as disallowed multiline strings or unsupported types.

- 🧭 **Code Navigation**  
  Navigate easily between sections and key-value pairs within the file.
